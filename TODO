- "flatten" coordinates of the map if too big for the screen 
  1. build a grid that allows every room to be seperately represented on
  the screen (aka, grid_h * grid_w >= nbr_rooms) and change the coordinates
  to match the new grid (put them proportionnaly at the same place in the new
  grid). if two rooms get the same x;y coordinates from this just place them
  elsewhere on the grid (just next to it, or ideally where it is most empty)
  2. if this does not work, do the same but only represent used rooms
  3. if this also fails, just print as is without caring about room collisions
  4. else just get the fuck out mate, you've done enough
- alternative start concentric view for big maps (end is on the edges)
- add a settings menu and a settings file to tweak lemin_tk's behavior
- the map editor (only with classic view)
- a map generator
- make it possible to run lemin_tk without providing it a map and to select
  the map and solver from a menu
- a checker to see if the solution is valid
