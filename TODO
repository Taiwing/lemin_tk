- refactor the visualizer in at least 3 parts
  - the map_shower that will just print the map (the core visualizer), make
    it so it can be used by the future map_editor
  - and a new function to remove unused rooms (just add a "used" state to
    the rooms), in fact, just make it an option of the visualizer (if the
	command is used in the map file it should also be possible to do that
	in the map editor)
- when the map is still too big, try to only print used rooms,
  and eventually also compress the map
- maybe queue the room collisions in compress coordinates to give priority
  to original coordinates (in the map compressor)
- add a settings menu and a settings file to tweak lemin_tk's behavior
- the map editor
- a map generator
- make it possible to run lemin_tk without providing it a map and to select
  the map and solver from a menu
- a checker to see if the solution is valid
