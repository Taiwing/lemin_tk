- when changing the size of the grid and/or the number of rooms (when toggling
  between printing and not printing unused rooms), and/or when grid_min is
  modified, change the minimum size of the window so that it fits the new grid
- maybe queue the room collisions in compress coordinates to give priority
  to original coordinates (in the map compressor)
- add a settings menu and a settings file to tweak lemin_tk's behavior
- the map editor
- a map generator
- make it possible to run lemin_tk without providing it a map and to select
  the map and solver from a menu
- optimize printing
