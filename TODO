- make map compression a parameter to be set
  - where 0% will be the original grid 100% will be the smallest
    grid possible, and every grid sizes will be in between
  - this could be done with two map compression parameters, one
    for the width and one for the height, this will be good for
    the map editor
- when the map is still too big, try to only print used rooms,
  and eventually also compress the map
- maybe stack the room collisions in compress coordinates to give priority
  to original coordinates
- draw all the links before the rooms (so that no link is above a room)
- add a settings menu and a settings file to tweak lemin_tk's behavior
- the map editor
- a map generator
- make it possible to run lemin_tk without providing it a map and to select
  the map and solver from a menu
- a checker to see if the solution is valid
