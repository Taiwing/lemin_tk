- refactor the visualizer in at least 3 parts
  - the map_shower that will just print the map (the core visualizer), make
    it so it can be used by the future map_editor
- maybe queue the room collisions in compress coordinates to give priority
  to original coordinates (in the map compressor)
- add a settings menu and a settings file to tweak lemin_tk's behavior
- the map editor
- a map generator
- make it possible to run lemin_tk without providing it a map and to select
  the map and solver from a menu
- optimize printing
